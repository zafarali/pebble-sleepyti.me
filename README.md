# Sleepyti.me for Pebble
*Say good-bye to groggy mornings ~ Created for McHacks 2015 -[ChallengePost](http://challengepost.com/software/sleepyti-me-for-pebble)*

As an sleep cycle enthusiast, the web app sleepyti.me has become the number one app to use before bed. It calculates the optimal REM cycles and suggests times for you to wake up. This is perfect for a Pebble App!

Coupled with a silent alarm clock this is a must have app to wake up refreshed!

## Motivation and Inspiration
Sleepyti.me is based on David Shaws wonderful [Sleepyti.me web app](https://github.com/davidshaw/sleepyti.me) at http://sleepyti.me. The motivation for this app was the need to learn C and the want to make a pebble app.
